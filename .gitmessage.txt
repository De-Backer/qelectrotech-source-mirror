Subject: Capitalized, short, summary, imperative

     Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue being
fixed, etc etc.
     The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about 74
characters or so. That way "git log" will show things nicely even when
it's indented.
     Make sure you explain your solution and why you're doing what
you're doing, as opposed to describing what you're doing. Reviewers
and your future self can read the patch, but might not understand why
a particular solution was implemented.

# Subject line:
# * Begin all subject lines with a capital letter
# * Do not end the subject line with a period
# * Limit the subject line to 50 characters
# * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    A properly formed Git commit subject line should
#    always be able to complete the following sentence:
#    - If applied, this commit will your subject line here
#
#    eg:
#       If applied, this commit will
#        - Remove deprecated methods
#        - Update qelectrotech gui
#        - Add file autonumber.h
#        - Add feature autonumber
#
# Separate subject from body with a blank line
#
# Wrap the body at 74 characters/line
# Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
